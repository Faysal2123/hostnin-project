        question: 'What is Web Hosting?',
        answer: `Web hosting is the service of storing data that keeps websites up and running for users.\n\nEvery website online has a host server, and almost all use a web host to manage that storage. However, not all web hosts provide the same level of quality.\n\nUptime, data speed, and transfer quantity are the most reliable measures of a hostâ€™s success. You can often pay more to get data transferred in higher quantities and at faster speeds. Most web hosts offer unlimited bandwidth and disk space at a speed suitable for small-to-moderate-sized businesses or individuals.\n\nCompanies with large websites may need to seek out a more advanced web host to meet their needs.`

        answer: `Disk space is an empty space that you can arrange however you like, just like when you pack your suitcase for a trip or furnish your home. For most websites with text and images, 3-5 GB should be plenty. If users will be downloading large multimedia files or there will be more than 500 visitors per day, you should think about getting a plan with more transfer bandwidth.`
